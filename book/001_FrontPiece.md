# Acknowledgement #

For their love, inspiration and support I thank my children Jessica, Maxime, Tegan and especially Samuel, who was still in the womb when I wrote my last acknowledgment. Thanks to all the people in my life; the close and not so close. You are too numerous to mention individually, but know that you are an amazing bunch, who constantly surprise and delight me. Thank you also to all the writers, mathematicians, musicians, scientists, painters, film makers, philosophers, sculptors and other artists that have touched my heart. I can only aspire to touching others in the same way. 

At a more practical level I must thank the technologists who made this work possible. The ebook was generated from a git repository of Markdown files using Pandoc and MacTex. So thanks must go to all the open source developers that made these tools possible. I must also than the creators of the images in the book many of whom have been kind enough to share their work under a creative commons license. Details of attributions are given at the end of the book. Finally I must thank Debbie Atkinson for her editing work. I hope I get to repay the favour soon. Needless to say, any errors that remain are entirely down to me.


# Preface #

This work started life as a series of blog posts written in 2017. When collecting such work together the question arises as to how much change one should make. I have opted to keep the original works much as they are. I have made only small edits to correct grammar, typos and very occasionally to improve clarity. I hope you enjoy these stories.
