Acknowledgements For their love, inspiration and support I thank my children Jessica, Maxime, Tegan and especially Samuel, who was still in the womb when I wrote my last acknowledgment. Thanks also to all the people in my life; the close and not so close. You are too numerous to mention individually, but know that you are an amazing bunch, who constantly surprise and delight me. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to all the writers, mathematicians, musicians, scientists, painters, film makers, philosophers, sculptors and other artists that have touched my heart. I can only aspire to touching others in the same way. At a more practical level I must thank the technologists who made this work possible. The ebook was generated from a git repository of RMarkdown files using R and RStudio. So thanks must go to all the open source developers that made these tools possible. I must also thank the creators of the images in the book many of whom have been kind enough to share their work under a creative commons license. Details of attributions are given at the end of the book. Finally I must thank Debbie Atkinson for her editing work. She excels at the standard editor stuff, picking up my frequent misuse of commas and apostrophes and letting me know, that while one’s wound might heal, a boat always heels. More than this, as the person that taught me marine navigation and got me into the whole sailboat with a cabin thing in the first place, she is able to point out that I really mean north east when I have written north west. I am so grateful for all of it. I hope I get to repay all the favours soon. Needless to say, any errors that remain are entirely down to me. Preface This work started life as a series of blog posts written in 2017 when, for various reasons which hopefully will become apparent to the reader, I decided to start journeying. When collecting such work together the question arises as to how much change one should make. I have opted to keep the original works much as they are. I have made only small edits to correct grammar, typos and, occasionally, to improve clarity. As far as references are concerned, I could have created footnotes and indexes. Instead, as this edition of these stories is only meant for electronic publication, I have kept all as web links. I am aware that this will make things difficult on e-readers without browsers. However, when reading on phones and tablets the links should work fine. In any case, the source chapters can be easily accesed online at the books git hub repository: https://github.com/ianksalter/djing_to_dolphins I hope you enjoy these tales.

["farewell-monday-10th-july-2017.html", "Chapter 1 Farewell (Monday 10th July 2017)", " Chapter 1 Farewell (Monday 10th July 2017) Chichester Canal (1828) J.M.W. Turner Goodbye Fairway, Rookwood, Sandhead, Snowhill, East Head Spit, Copyhold, Stocker, Mid-Winner, Fishery, North Winner, North West Winner and Eaststoke and the other buoys of Chichester. Farewell also to the marks at Chichester, Birdham, Itchenor, Chalkdock, Camber, West Winner, Bar Beacon and of course the West Pole. Though the latter two I will most probably glimpse again one last time. Thank you all for keeping me safe and out of the shallows for the past two years. I’m sailing out of Chichester Harbour for the last time. In the past couple of months I have spent a lot of time in this area. As someone that doesn’t own a car this has mostly been on a bicycle. Often traveling to and from the town of Chichester, or along the coast to Emsworth and Havant, mainly to the train stations but also sometimes to swim, buy food or just meet up with friends. People often ask me how can you cycle in London, isn’t it really dangerous. They have clearly never tried taking a fully laden bike down a narrow country lane in the dark and experienced a car passing centimetres away at 60 miles an hour. Consequently choosing routes that avoid roads has been key. My first route took the canal. This was fine on a big old dutch bike but when I started using my modified road bike, it proved impassable. It was then that my daughter Maxime and I discovered the Saltern’s Way, the 18km cycle way from the center of Chichester to the dunes of East Head. It takes me from the marina into Chichester for the train station, supermarket and swimming pool. It also connects with the cycle lane to Emsworth and Havant. From near it you can also catch, what must be one of the world’s smallest ferries, from Itchenor to Bosham. As I have cycled along, I have been immersed in the rural home counties. I pass through wheat, barley, potatoes and, even at one point, two fields of lupins. Wildlife abounds. Rabbits either scurry back to their burrows or stand stock still as I cycle past. Blackbirds, thrushes, sparrows and birds that I can’t name, regularly fly past. I count Magpies, that round here seem to be mostly solitary creatures. Closer to water, care must be taken to avoid the fluffy young of ducks, swans, moorhens and coots as they attempt to venture into your path before being shooed back by worried parents. The route is also steeped in history. The Roman Palace at Fishbourne sits to its western side. The Cathedral at Chichester, whose spire acts as as destination mark when you are heading north, was consecrated in 1108. Close to my marina, bordering the western side of the trail, is the site of the former Appledram Airfield that was used by the RAF as an advanced landing ground for the liberation of Europe. Sometimes Spitfires from nearby Goodwood fly overhead. This is the Britain of Betjeman and I can imagine Miss Joan Hunter-Dunn serving from one of the courts of the tennis club that, at some point, I glimpse from my bike. While I do find it strangely beguiling and comforting, this land of Agatha Christie’s Marple and of the Potters, both Beatrix and Dennis, also has a dark undercurrent that has a lot to do with journey that I’m undertaking. My ultimate destination is a long way to the south and the west but, typically for me, today I am heading north and east. Not all routes are a straight line from A to B. That’s because the ‘to’ is sometimes as important as the A and the B. This story like my route I figure, will neither be simple or straight forward. I haven’t even started at the beginning. "],
["glasgow-to-inverkip-wednesday-1st-march-2017.html", "Chapter 2 Glasgow to Inverkip (Wednesday 1st March 2017)", " Chapter 2 Glasgow to Inverkip (Wednesday 1st March 2017) Saturday night, on the Clyde at Glasgow (XIX cent.) John Atkinson Grimshaw My train inches out of Glasgow Central station and across the Clyde. It is golden hour, that time when the sun is near the horizon, beloved of photographers because of its richness. Though there are some clouds, the day is as bright and welcoming as all the interactions that I have had with people since rolling off the overnight sleeper coach at Buchanan St bus station. The train gathers speed through an industrial area, diving into a cutting. We emerge to local authority housing on one side with industry framed by distant mountains on the other. We stop at Hilington West. Though I took this train less than three weeks ago, I have no memory of this part of the journey. Presumably I was preoccupied with the decision that I was about to make. It had been my daughter Maxime’s birthday, exactly 26 years since I had jumped for joy in the doorway of 27 Watermead House and whacked my head pretty hard. Though on that day in February I would end up celebrating with Max in Glasgow, her birthday wasn’t the reason for my visit. The train pulls into Paisley Gilmore Street and I reflect on how the dark stone of the Victorian buildings has become much warmer to me since I first started visiting this part of the world. Today’s journey is a consequence of the decision I was coming to on Maxime’s birthday. Some aspects of attraction are about how things look at rest. For me the moving component had always been more important. I had seen images of her, I’d even been to see her in person, but it was when we danced across the Clyde on my daughter’s birthday that, in the words of Sapsorrow, “my head hurt and my tummy ached and my skin tingled and my heart did little somersaults”. I left her that day and returned to party with Maxime, her friends and my two other daughters; Jessica and Tegan, eventually bedding down on the sleeper bus back to London with a beautiful confusion in my heart. By Monday my mind was made up. I was going to spend significantly more time with her. This train journey is the start of that relationship. At Port Glasgow the docks and cranes lay idle. I’m later told by a taxi driver that things won’t start to pick up until the cruise ships arrive later in the year. The distant hills are still capped in snow. The clouds seem to have mostly gone. School children join the otherwise empty train at Whinhill so I move my bags to make space for them. As golden hour fades, the day gets brighter and my mood soars. I am temporarily distracted by my phone. When I lift my head again and see, what I remember from before as the drab public sector homes of Branchton, glowing in the sunshine. The sun though, can do nothing for the derelict commercial buildings at IBM Holt. These remain as sad as I remember. The train crosses a gorge with a stream and we emerge from the trees to Inverkip where private sector housing seems to dominate. The station has only one platform indicating that we are only one stop away from the end of the line. I gather my bags together, leave the train and set myself up for a walk down the hill and the beginning of my new life with Kite. "],
